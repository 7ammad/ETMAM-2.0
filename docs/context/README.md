# Context documents (optional in-repo copy)

This folder is intended to hold a **copy** of the 8 Etmam 2.0 context documents so the repo is self-contained for:

- Claude Code CLI and other reviewers
- Other machines or teammates
- Handover

**Source:** `C:\Users\7amma\.cursor\context\`

**Files to copy:**

- IDEA.md  
- PRD.md  
- APP-FLOW.md  
- TECH-STACK.md  
- BACKEND.md  
- FRONTEND.md  
- IMPLEMENTATION.md  
- TENDER-STRUCTURE.md  

If this folder is empty, use the primary path above and point agents/reviewers at `docs/PROJECT-LEAD-GUIDE.md` for how to use the context.
